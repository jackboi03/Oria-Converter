**THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND MIGHT NOT WORK AS INTENDED!**
**USE AT YOU OWN RISK!**

Oria Converter is a converter that converts ItemsAdder configs to Oraxen configs and vice versa. 
The focus of Oria is to make switching from ItemsAdder to Oraxen more accessible and easy, as the user does not have to manually convert everything themselves.

**For now, Oria can only convert item files from ItemsAdder to Oraxen and vice versa!**
*Other config files may become available to convert in the future!*

*If you want to support the development of this, consider donating me on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com*
